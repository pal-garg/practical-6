<div id="section2"><p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most 
widely used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) 
are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML 
is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web 
browser how to structure it to display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure 
of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information 
between researchers</p></div>
